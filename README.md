Examples of interacting with bitcoin network via Bitcore NodeJS implementation for Cryptography and Complexity class

Exercise 3.1. regtest.sh is a shell script to start a clean blockchain 

Exercise 3.2.1 exe1.sh the script generates two new addresses (A and B), mines blocks, sends the block reward to A and finally sends money from A to B

Exercise 3.3.1. exe1.sh the second part of the script sets shell variable for the utxo, txid, vout, and scriptPubKey of the above transaction

Exercise 4.3. example1.js nodejs script which sets up new address using bitcore 

Exercise 4.4.1 example2.js executes a standard transaction with bitcore

Exercise 4.4.2 example3.js adds data to a standard transaction

Exercise 4.4.3 example4.js generates JSON for transaction

Exercise 4.5 freeze.js shows freezing funds until a certain block height is reached

Exercise 5. args-regtest.js parses arguments from bash too JS

Exercise  5.1. freeze1.js executes freezing funds while taking arguments from bash
